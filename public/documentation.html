    <h1>Documentation for myFlix API</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of the myFlix API is to serve as the server-side component for a movies web application. This API provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of favorite movies.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>The myFlix API is part of a full-stack JavaScript development project known as Achievement 2. It forms the server-side component of the myFlix web application. In Achievement 3, the client-side component will be built using React. The complete tech stack, including MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack), will be mastered throughout this project.</p>

    <h2>The 5 Ws</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Frontend developers working on the client-side and movie enthusiasts who want access to movie-related information.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> A well-designed REST API built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Users interact with the myFlix application to read about movies, update their information, or manage their list of favorite movies.</li>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> The myFlix application is hosted online and is accessible from any device.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> To provide movie enthusiasts with access to information about movies, directors, and genres, and to enable users to manage their movie preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
