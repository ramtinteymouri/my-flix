    <h1>Documentation for myFlix API</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of the myFlix API is to serve as the server-side component for a movies web application. This API provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of favorite movies.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>The myFlix API is part of a full-stack JavaScript development project known as Achievement 2. It forms the server-side component of the myFlix web application. In Achievement 3, the client-side component will be built using React. The complete tech stack, including MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack), will be mastered throughout this project.</p>

    <h2>The 5 Ws</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Frontend developers working on the client-side and movie enthusiasts who want access to movie-related information.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> A well-designed REST API built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Users interact with the myFlix application to read about movies, update their information, or manage their list of favorite movies.</li>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> The myFlix application is hosted online and is accessible from any device.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> To provide movie enthusiasts with access to information about movies, directors, and genres, and to enable users to manage their movie preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>

    <h3>User Stories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As a user, I want to receive information on movies, directors, and genres.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to create a profile and save data about my favorite movies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Feature Requirements</h3>
    <h4>Essential Features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Return a list of all movies.</li>
        <li>Return data about a single movie by title.</li>
        <li>Return data about a genre by name.</li>
        <li>Return data about a director by name.</li>
        <li>Allow new users to register.</li>
        <li>Allow users to update their user info.</li>
        <li>Allow users to add/remove movies from their list of favorites.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Optional Features:</h4>
    <p>Additional features for future iterations of the application.</p>

    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Node.js and Express application.</li>
        <li>REST architecture with URL endpoints.</li>
        <li>Use of middleware modules.</li>
        <li>MongoDB database.</li>
        <li>Business logic modeled with Mongoose.</li>
        <li>JSON format for movie information.</li>
        <li>Error-free JavaScript code.</li>
        <li>Testing in Postman.</li>
        <li>User authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li>Data validation logic.</li>
        <li>Compliance with data security regulations.</li>
        <li>Source code deployment to GitHub and Heroku.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Deliverables</h2>
    <p>The myFlix API will be developed incrementally through a series of exercises, each contributing to the final product. The documentation for each exercise will ensure high-quality deliverables for incorporation into a professional portfolio.</p>
